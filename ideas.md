Working remotely
===================================

Working remotely sounds *great*.  We think we’ll save ourselves the commute and we’ll be able to flexibly weave in and out of work and home life. In reality, work takes a different shape when there is no office, and we’re all in different environments trying to connect to other humans. 

We have no “central” office at [Hypothesis](http://hypothes.is/ "Hypothes.is") and we currently work from 4 different countries in different time zones.  We have learned that communication, decision making, social interaction and leadership need slightly different strategies.  We still have much to improve, but we’re working on it every day.

These are some of the things we’ve learned while working remotely:

* [Communication](#communication)
* [Schedule and time management](#schedule-time)



<a name="communication">Communication</a> 
-------------

* **Read, write everything down, repeat.** Working remotely will require you to write and read much more than you think.  Write your thoughts, explain how you came to a conclusion, propose a solution in writing.  Your input will be required in writing too, and there’s a number of emails and documents that you definitively need to read to keep up with what’s going on. You will find yourself repeating things many times, in different documents/meetings/chat rooms, and that’s ok.

* **Rules of polite communication are not the same.** Sometimes you will have to interrupt people, hijack a meeting, reschedule at the last minute, ask people to repeat themselves etc.  You still get to be nice to people, say thank you, please and sorry, say “good morning” and “have a good evening”.

* **Interruptions are OK.** Don’t be afraid to ask people if they have a minute. it’s on the recipient to manage their time and availability (i.e turning off their slack notifications, or saying “sorry I can’t right now, I’m on a call”).  Don’t guess on other people’s availability, just ask.

* **Be direct.**  Don’t “ask to ask” or bury your request in a full paragraph.  Lead with your request or question, and provide a format for the response you want (yes/no, comments on a document, +1s or -1s, etc).  Keep your sentences short, you don’t need to heavily justify everything you say, we believe you!

* **Don’t read too much into things.** Don’t interpret lags, non-responses, silences, missed events, short emails, dropped pending items, cut-off chat conversations or distracted interlocutors. Chances are these are incidental communication issues, not intentional messages. 

* **Plain, human language.**  No one should be furiously googling the word you just said. Try to keep the jargon out of our group conversations: [jargon tips the power balance](https://medium.com/@amacduff/avoiding-jargon-ec1cc0e1759c#.y60j1xvj7 "Avoiding Jargon") and alienates people. If you don’t know what X is, please ask immediately, even if you just need a refresher. 

* **Informal conversations, chats just for the LOLs, are OK.**  It’s also OK to politely decline if you’re busy. This is awkward, but it’s the only way we can have informal conversations when we’re not in the same room.  It’s perfectly fine to chat about music, puppies, breakfast and animated gifs. It’s fine to make jokes in conference calls. HAVE FUN.

* **Response lag.** Do not expect an immediate response, and don’t feel pressured to respond immediately, unless something is on fire (in which case we will have an appropriate way to ping you).  Give people time to switch context, think, and process. If you need a quick response, please indicate that in your request (i.e. “I have a meeting in 1hr and I need your thoughts on this” or “whenever you get a chance before the end of the week”)

* **Asking questions.** The earlier you ask a question, the happier we’ll all be. Don’t struggle with a problem or a doubt by yourself, just ask someone. It doesn’t matter if they look busy (remember, it’s their job to manage their own time).  [Ask detailed questions](http://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask "How to Ask") and give indications of the type of answer you’re looking for (an idea, step by step instructions, help troubleshooting, debugging, testing something out, etc)

* **Communication style.** When you’re working different hours in a different place, co-workers have no context for how your day has been or what mood you’re in. Maybe it’s too early in the morning and they didn’t sleep well, maybe it’s been a long day of chasing an annoying bug.  Take deep breaths, be aware of your emotional state, be as positive and open as you can be. Practice empathy, ask how other people’s days have been, try to understand context and assume the best.

* **Isolation.**  Everyone who works remotely at some point feels isolated, out of the loop, or trying to catch up with what’s going on. You will have the vague feeling that discussions, decisions and important things are happening elsewhere, and you’re missing out. This is, most likely not true. The only way to find out is to raise the issue, ask how things are going, ask your manager for general org update. 

* **English: not everyone’s first language!**  Be compassionate and forgiving, but don’t be afraid to correct us nicely (this helps us, seriously).  We will do the same with your Hindi/Spanish/German/Irish/others.

<a href="schedule-time">Schedule and time management</a>
----------------------------

* **Individual time management.**  You’re responsible for your own time. This is extremely important.  You get to define when you’re available and when it's OK to contact you.  You have to accept/decline meeting invites, set up the appropriate reminders, set yourself away on the shared calendar, snooze your Slack notifications, and plan for your week/day.  You get to decide when to switch contexts. No one can do this for you.

* **Calendar invite etiquette.** Provide context for all meeting invites (perhaps have a little chat with the people you’re inviting before sending it). Make some attendants clearly optional, if they are. Include the meeting main goal on the invite, and if there’s an agenda or supporting documents, include links to those too.  The default for a meeting should be 30 minutes, consider if you really need more. Send notifications if you need to reschedule a meeting or cancel it. 

* **Avoid expensive meetings.**  Think about the minimal set of people who should attend a meeting, and what their role or input will be. Is this something that can be communicated via email? If a recurring meeting keeps being canceled, maybe you should rethink the need for that meeting or its frequency. 

* **Scheduling across timezones.** Define a time band for meetings on your day.  What is reasonable and acceptable?  Use the [Meeting Planner](http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meeting.html "Meeting Planner") if you need to find a good hour to meet. You can also use the [“find a time”](https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/37161?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en "Google calendar help") feature of Google calendar. Finally, ask if it’s possible to reschedule a meeting that is outside of your work hours, or if someone else can attend on your behalf. Don’t expect others to worry about your time (remember this is your job). 

* **International holidays.** We have an approximate list of international holidays on the countries where our team usually live.  The general rule is:  if the holiday is on the list, we don’t expect you to be available. If it’s not on the list, but it’s important for you, let us know in advance and take the day off (put it in the team calendar).  Team meetings where the 30%+ of participants are on holiday will be rescheduled.

* **Etiquette during meetings.**  Start max 5 minutes after the starting time, maybe other people need pings and reminders.  Remember Gunner’s rule:  In a group of n people, try to talk 1/nth of the time.  Keep the agenda in mind and mentally check what points have been covered, and what is yet to be discussed. Don’t be offended if someone else mutes your microphone during the meeting, you may not notice the background noise. Our meeting time band is very limited and chances are your participants have other calls on the hour: finish on time (or early!). If there was not enough time to finish a discussion, make sure you follow up.

* **Block time on the calendar.**  We have an open vacation policy but we often have to remind people to block time off not only for vacation but also errands, travel time, mental health, reading and studying, feeding the baby, walking the dog, picking up the kids, taking your mom to an appointment. Any time you need without interruptions should be blocked, we don’t need to know why.
